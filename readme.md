# Computer Networks Lab – Smart Gardening Automation

## Project Overview

**Smart Gardening Automation** is a web-controlled irrigation system that autonomously monitors soil conditions and waters plants based on real-time sensor data. This project integrates IoT technologies to optimize water usage and ensure efficient plant care.

## Tech Stack

- **IoT Hardware:** ESP8266, DHT11 Sensor, LM35 Sensor, 12V Pump
- **Backend:** Node.js
- **Hosting, Database, Authentication:** Firebase (NoSQL)

## Features

- **Automated Irrigation** – Waters plants based on real-time soil moisture levels.
- **Web-Based Control** – Users can monitor and control the system remotely.
- **Sensor Integration** – Utilizes DHT11 for humidity & temperature monitoring and LM35 for soil temperature.
- **Real-Time Updates** – Firebase ensures instant data synchronization.
- **Secure Access** – Firebase authentication protects user data and system controls.
